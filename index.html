				<p style="margin: 0.5em">I come from the faraway lands of Queretaro, Mexico, where we spend most of our time sipping on tequila and sleeping under the shade of cacti. That actually sounds good, but in reality we have to work and to do that (succesfully) we must strive to become the best version of ourselves. I came to the USA in 2009 to study Engineering Science at Trinity University and followed it with a masters in Mechanical Engineering from Rice University. This is how I ended up in the beautiful, culturally diverse (and traffic infested) city of Houston, Texas.
				<br />
				<br />
				You would think that a mechanical engineer wants nothing to do with web development, but fortunately, I had to take a computer science class in college and it opened my eyes to this weird world of software. Unfortunately, this happened in my senior year and was a little late (and expensive) to pursue the computer science major. 
				<br />
				<br />
				That was not going to stop me. One should not stop learning and I have finally convinced myself (and my wife) to take the next step to become a great web developer/programmer/computer thing.
